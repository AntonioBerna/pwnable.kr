## Mini docs

The aim of these games is to find the flag, in fact they are real CTFs (Capture The Flags).

> [!CAUTION]
> For more information about games visit [https://pwnable.kr/play.php](https://pwnable.kr/play.php). Registration is required to solve the games.

The only requirement is to install Python's [pwntools](https://pypi.org/project/pwntools/) library.

> [!TIP]
> If you have never used the `pwntools` library I recommend you consult the [official documentation](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/).
